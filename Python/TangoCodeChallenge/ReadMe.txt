The test.py program works to implement a "PieChart Timer", which will help the caller track where time is being spent between two points in a piece of code and generate a piechart.

The main.py program provides 6 test cases for test.py. It works perfect with testcase 1, 3, 4 and 6. But in testcase 5, where one period is extremely small, it will get a kill 9 error. And in testcase 2, where all the period takes very little time, it will only generate a line.

To run those 6 different test cases, simply add "testCase4()" at the end of main.py file, or the correspongding test case, and run main.py.
